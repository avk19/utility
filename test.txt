AutoSys communication involves agents and the AutoSys Scheduler (or CLI Server) to execute jobs and commands effectively. Here is a detailed breakdown:


---

1. Communication Flow

AutoSys Agent: Installed on the target machine where jobs run.

AutoSys Scheduler (CLI Server): Hosts the AutoSys Event Processor and manages job execution commands.


The communication between the AutoSys agent and CLI server generally uses the CA Workload Automation AutoSys protocol with a secure channel (e.g., TCP/IP).

1. Job Submission:
When a job is defined and scheduled, the Event Processor on the scheduler communicates with the AutoSys agent to:

Start, stop, or monitor the job execution.

Retrieve job status and return logs/output.



2. Command Execution:
For commands initiated from the AutoSys CLI (e.g., autorep, sendevent, or job execution), the CLI interacts with:

The AutoSys Database for job details.

The AutoSys Agent through the Event Processor.



3. Communication Protocol:

AutoSys uses TCP/IP for communication between the CLI Server, Scheduler, and Agents.

Default ports:

Event Server: Port 7520 (configurable).

Agent Port: Default is AutoSys Agent Listener (Port 5280).

2. Commands Used in AutoSys CLI

sendevent:
Used to send events such as starting a job, stopping it, or defining a job's status.

Example:

sendevent -E STARTJOB -J job_name

autorep:
Reports the status of jobs.

Example:

autorep -J job_name -d


These commands pass through the CLI server and route commands to the agent via the Event Processor.

3. References to Documentation

Official documentation from Broadcom for CA Workload Automation AutoSys includes details on communication and processes. You can refer to:

1. CA Workload Automation AE Documentation

Look for topics on "Agent Communication", "Event Processor", and "CLI Commands".



2. AutoSys Agent Installation and Configuration Guide

Details the ports, protocols, and settings for agent-to-server communication.
